1.	In this workshop, I learned how to use array, and how to use for loop to iterate over an array
2.	What was good about using arrays â€“ what were the alternatives (how else could you have done it)?
It is good for storing and calculating series of values, in previous lab, we discarded the data after the calculation and sometimes there is no good alternative.
3.	Comment on the use of parallel (matching) arrays. In what ways were they good and/or bad?

Good:  It is good for storing more than one attributes of an object, when we facing a data with a lot of attributes, for example, a student has an ID number, mark, and more, we can create an array for each of those attributes. 

Bad:   I think it is hard to choose the length of the array.

4.	Iterating (looping) through arrays is a common practice; why is it a best practice to initialize iterator variables to a value of zero (0)?
In for loop, we initialize i with 0, so it matches the starting index of an array, thus providing more convenient way to write the expression of accessing the values in an array.
