In this milestone, I learned how to use prototypes in header file to link functions in different c source files and how to use struct pointer.

- An explanation of why you think this assignment has asked you to code a struct, Contact, that holds three other structs as data members.

Because Contact contains the other 3 struct types. They have composition relationship.

- An explanation why it would be poor design to pass a pointer to type Contact as an argument in the functions getName, getAddress, and getNumbers.

As a guideline for a strucuterd design, the less inforamtion that passes between the module and the other modules the better the design.
We should pass only the information the function need so it exhibits low coupling
